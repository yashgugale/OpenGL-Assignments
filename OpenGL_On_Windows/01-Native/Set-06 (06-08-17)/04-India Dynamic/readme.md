Steps to compile/run:
1. Open "Visual Studio" (preferably 2010, 2015 or 2017.)
2. Create an "empty win32 project".
3. Right click on "project"->"Add existing"->".cpp file" and add the "01-India Dynamic.cpp" file to the project.
4. In the same project directory, add the sound file.
5. Now "build" the project.
6. Next, "start debugging".
7. The program will run and you will see the output.
(Note: Switch to fullscreen by pressing 'f' so that the music will be in sync with the rendering. OpenGL rendering speed changes on fullscreen.
Hence, you need to change to fullscreen immediately for correct sync.)
