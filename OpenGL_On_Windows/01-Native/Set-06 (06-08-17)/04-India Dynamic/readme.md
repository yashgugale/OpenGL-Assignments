About: 
This program demonstrates the use of basic drawing primitives in OpenGL to create a simple animation of the text "INDIA".
Window is created using Win32 programming and sound is added for effect.


Steps to compile/run:
1. Open "Visual Studio" (preferably 2010, 2015 or 2017.)
2. Create an "empty win32 project".
3. Right click on "project"->"Add"->"Existing item"->".cpp file" and add the "01-India Dynamic.cpp" file to the project.
4. In the same project directory, add the sound file.
5. Now "Build"-"Build Solution" to build the project.
6. Next, "Debug"->"Start debugging".
7. The program will run and you will see the output.
(Note: Switch to fullscreen by pressing 'f' so that the music will be in sync with the rendering. OpenGL rendering speed changes on fullscreen.
Hence, you need to change to fullscreen immediately for correct sync.)
